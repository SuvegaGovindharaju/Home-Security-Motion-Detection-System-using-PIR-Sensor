# Home-Security-Motion-Detection-System-using-PIR-Sensor

## üìå Overview
This project is a **motion detection security system** built using the **Raspberry Pi Pico (RP2040)**, a **PIR motion sensor**, **LED**, and **Buzzer**.  
When motion is detected within range, the system triggers a **visual (LED)** and **audio (Buzzer)** alert for a few seconds, then resets automatically.  
It is a **low-cost and efficient solution** for home, office, and automation security needs.

## üéØ Objective
To design and implement an affordable and effective **Home Security System** that:
- Detects motion in real-time.
- Provides immediate **audio-visual alerts**.
- Resets automatically for continuous monitoring.

## üíª Software
- **Thonny IDE** (for programming with MicroPython)  
- **Wokwi Online Simulator** (for virtual testing and debugging)  

## ‚öôÔ∏è Working Principle
1. The **PIR Sensor** detects infrared radiation changes when a human/animal moves within range.  
2. The **Raspberry Pi Pico** receives the PIR sensor‚Äôs signal.  
3. On detection, the **LED and Buzzer** are activated for **6 seconds**, providing visual and audio alerts.  
4. After the delay, the system resets and continues monitoring for new motion.
